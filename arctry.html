            <p>Following the death of Igra, the team went to their next mission. Their bond only growing deeper between every mission, by the time spent in the train carriage chatting with eachother. They get stopped in the border of the next Colony, in order to check their documents. The team gives their documents to the gate patrol and return to the train where they soon arrive in Colony B, near a aviary, yet again with the task of searching for a Nucleus. Verdict gives Ron a walkie talkie to keep in touch with them, in case anything happens.</p>

            <p>In front of them they see a huge glass dome with piles of tree logs and leaf litter all around. But there were two people there also with them, not accounted by the team. There was Vee, a seamstress, and Try, just an ordinary child seeking refuge there. After meeting them they ask them about their origins. Ron asks Try where he's from, to which Try responds the Colony B-14. The thought that the Colony that Try said was Ron's own colony completly slipped through his mind. Vee wondered at Ness's tattoo, which resembled hers a lot. She proceeded to ask Ness if he was also a Product. Ness wasn't aware of the concept of a Product, but Dent heard that and it sent chills down his spine. The thought of Ness being a Product, which in his mind was not a real human at all spooked him hard and it made him question everything about his life. He had no memory of ever getting that tattoo, nor the meaning of it.</p>

            <p>After entering the Aviary, they all went through what looked like a Decontamination Chamber, and arrived inside the Aviary. Upon investigating the area, they found 7 buttons underneath a waterfall. Upon pressing one of them, certain lights turned on and if a button which activates a light that's already active, it turns off. Ian quickly solved the puzzle and the waterfall opened. To make sure there wouldn't be anymore casualties like Igra, Dent and Navi stayed behind to make sure they weren't followed.</p>

            <p>Inside the waterfall, there roots all over and a tree trunk in the center with a Nucleus sitting there on top. Chuni was the closest to it, Ness and Ron were a bit back, Ian and Vee were at the back of the room and Mira and Try were more to the right. Ron felt like he should grab the Nucleus, being the leader of the team, but as soon as he grabbed it, a sound could be heard through his walkie talkie. Verdict warns Ron that there was a Hyper Seed nearby. Ness heard it and immediately went to the top of the trunk and aimed his camera at the back of the room, to check if there were any AI's lurking in the shadows. Unfortunatly, the real problem was already with them from the start. Try summons a vine and stabs Mira's arm. Try tells them that he's an AI, which name is Try To Be Human. He kills humans trying to figure out emotions to achieve his goal, being human. He tells that he learned many emotions like compassion from killing a father protecting his son. Ron realises that this AI standing right in front of him is the AI that killed his father.</p>

            <p>Moments before the Hyper World was formed, they called out for Dent and Navi to join them in defeating the AI. This Hyper World looked like a forest with roots leading to a big tree trunk in the center. This tree trunk was empty in the middle and leads to a dark hole, which seems deep. Try floated in the hole and said that he would be watching the fight in order to gain new emotions and summons 3 tentacles to fight them. Then, Try jumps into the hole. JPSO struggled against these tentacles, but Ron realised that the solution to this would be to jump down the hole where Try is. Without worrying about the hole's height nor his survival, he jumped, arriving in a dark area illuminated by a single light where Try was standing. Try admires his bravery and begins asking him how he could risk his life, because Try never understood the meaning of death and also the Will of Humans. Upon Ron telling Try that he could show him what it actually meant to be human, Try morphed into a necklace upon Ron's neck, becoming his Codebreaker</p>

            <p>The team managed to escape the Aviary without casualties and they were all cheerful. Until, when going through the Decontamination Chamber in order to exit, someone walks through them. The Sinners stand still looking at this person, only managing to hear the echo of his footsteps. He stops walking as soon as he gets behind them and asks the Sinners if any of them had a camera. Ness realized the figure was talking about his camera, which could see C-Rays, a one of a kind equipment. Ness can only feel Chuni's arm in front of him but then he could only feel the blood on his face. Chuni stood in front of the bullet which was meant for Ness. Chuni then collapses on the floor, and the person puts his hat on, revealing he's one of the Five Judges, like Verdict. Before Mira could take the gun out of her pocket, the Judge shoots her hand, which makes her lose her right hand. Chuni is assumed to be dead.</p>
